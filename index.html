        <h4>~A website designed to innovate data collection with trash cleanups~</h4>


        <a href="http://ww.google.com" target = "blank">We plan to create a website that users are able to catalog what types of trash/plastics they
        are finding for beach cleanups.</a> We will try to include the amount of each trash, the date, and 
        location. The user would input said data and the information would be logged so the <em>database can
        be used for data analysis for research</em>. We will use various coding languages and software. 
        The website has the potential to be used to collect a significant amount of data about global
        plastic pollution.
